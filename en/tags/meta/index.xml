      <description>A tale of me discovering, learning and playing with a new set of toys for my blog&amp;hellip;&#xA;Racket Here is where it all started. A new programming language and some youtube videos led me to my first step on this journey. Emacs Lisp is the programming language underlying Emacs. I discovered Racket after exploring all the Lispy type languages available today. The Racket documentation impresses me and that led me to Scribble, the module inside Racket for writing (primarily) documentation.</description>

      <description>Originally published on 25-06-2019&#xA;updated: switched from using Netlify to Github.io&#xA;Blogs are a thing&amp;hellip; again. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried doing them over the years with little success. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I found it more interesting to fiddle with the blog back-end rather than the actual blog itself. This time it&amp;rsquo;s different! (I hope)&#xA;This is how my words get to the site:&#xA;In EMACS I open my blog file called &amp;ldquo;all-posts.</description>

      <description>I use a mac. I use EMACS. I use a bunch of other apps too; even other word processors and text editors. But I gravitate towards EMACS when I&amp;rsquo;m on my main computer. It has become my primary tool for many things that normally have a flagship app. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried the venerable OmniFocus and Things apps for to-do lists and projects. Now I use org-mode in EMACS. I&amp;rsquo;ve got Day One as a journaling app but now I use org-mode.</description>
