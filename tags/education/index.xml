      <description>The Photos app in macOS has a feature that can recognize faces of the people in your photo library. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty remarkable. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a perfect job but you can correct it and train it to be better and better over time. It can also recognize the faces of my kids as they grow older. Amazing. My phone looks for and recognizes my face to unlock it. Netflix recommends shows I might enjoy based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve already watched.</description>
