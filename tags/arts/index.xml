      <description>My boys loved the two Dune movies by Denis Villeneuve. We saw the second one in 70mm IMAX at the Chinese theater in Hollywood on our family vacation. Quite the spectacle.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m impressed they understood the conflict of the main hero, Paul, and his struggle with accepting his destiny. Once they realized this was only the beginning of a much longer story, they were inspired to read the book. I wonder if this will be the spark that ignites their desire to read more.</description>
