<p>At last.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is now in his third week of a criminal trial in New York. So far, none of the terrible things his MAGA followers predicted has come true. There are no riots in the streets, no mass protests, no stock market crash&hellip; nothing. Instead, there has been an orderly proceeding overseen by an experienced trial judge. Trump has predictably ranted and raved at the &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; of it all. Calling the judge <em>comprimised</em>, <em>crooked</em>, and the tired &ldquo;no person has been treated as unfairly as I have&rdquo; trope is wearing thin.</p>
<p>While his conviction isn&rsquo;t certain, the narrative surrounding this trial is certainly against him. His daily blustering in front of court cameras is tired and repetitive. The stories of him falling asleep everyday during trial undermine his &ldquo;Sleepy Joe&rdquo; strategy. He&rsquo;s looking older and weaker than he has in months. Accounts of him farting in court make him a laughing stock. In short, this is all bad for his <em>image</em>.</p>
<p>The trial, so far, is worse. The testimony and evidence describe a corrupt scheme to influence an election. And we haven&rsquo;t even heard from the principle players yet. Unless there is a biased juror or two that can hang the jury, Trump will be found guilty. Trump will be a convicted felon. The presumptive GOP nominee for the 2024 presidential election will be a convicted felon. Not only will he be an adjudicated <em>rapist</em> and <em>financial fraud</em>, he will be a <em>convicted felon</em>.</p>
<p>His only play is to claim the system is <em>rigged</em>, Biden is behind this <em>witch-hunt</em>, everyone is against him.</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
